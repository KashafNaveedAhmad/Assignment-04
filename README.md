# Assignment-04
In this assignment i've converted the previous assignent no 3 into a group of functions. 
# Function:
'Function' is a set of instructions that perform specific task.Through functions,one can acess the local or child block of code at any point in the global code block.That can reduce redundancy ,makes the program efficient and reusable.
# Syntax of 'Function'/Function defining:
def function_name ():
  block of statements
(The indent/spacing above shows that the block of statements are part of function.And where the indent ends the functions end aswell.)
# Syntax of 'Function call':
function_name()
(When a function is called the control moves to the function definition.)
# How the 'Function' work?
After defining a function when a function is called,The control moves to the function call to function definition.Then a block of statements inside the function definition executes. After that the control moves back to the function call.And on to the next line in the program.
